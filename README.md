### Rock Paper Scissors
This project is a rock, paper, scissors game that I built using my Javascript, CSS, and HTML learning.  It makes use of class to class interaction to allow the user to play two versions of the game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.

### Abstract
I created a Star Wars: The Mandalorian themed rock, paper, scissors game.  Players can take on the quest of "The Mandalorian" and play against the computer in a race against time and the Empire to save the Galaxy from Starkiller Base, the next Looming threat.  Win three more games than the computer and stop Starkiller Base from moving across the galaxy.  You have the option to play classic rock, paper, scissors, or a more complex version.  The complex version fully immerses you in a galaxy far, far away world by allowing you to chose the roles of a Mandalorian, a Jedi, The New Republic, A Sith, or a Stormtrooper.

### Context:
This project is the final Mod 1 solo project.  It was assigned on the 28th of February, and was due on the 7th of March.  Overall, I put 2-3 hours of work into the project each day, for a total of around 20 hours of work time.

### Learning Goals / Achievements
- My goals for this project were to master DOM and Data Model manipulation, understand how to use flexbox, and incorporate the WAVE extension into my workflow.
- I learned to only display information stored in the Data Model and directly pass user input to update it.
- Despite encountering difficulties, I persisted in working with flexbox, and it paid off for this project.
- WAVE extension helped me understand how to use more semantic HTML elements, and I plan to use it in all my future work.
